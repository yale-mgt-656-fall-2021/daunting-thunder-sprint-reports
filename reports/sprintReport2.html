        <h4>Narrative of Accomplishments and Challenges</h4>
        <p> 
            We continued progress on the website by prioritizing and assigning stories for Sprint 2.
            Jeremy added new story points in ZenHub that we as a team agreed upon to build in Sprint 2 and created html documents for Sprint Report 2. 
            Bernardo started working on making the "Create New Event" feature functional (remains in progress) as well as adding RSVP feature and Google Analytics.
            Philippe created a team logo for us to put in the header of the app in the next sprint. 
            Vincent compiled our Sprint 2 report.
            
            Note that since we are working on distinct features, we began using some branches to keep organized and minimize conflicts. We had difficulty finding time to meet as a group, but found that 
            Slack and ZenHub made it pretty simple to communicate asynchronously and still keep track of each team member's progress.

        <h4>Narrative of Expected Work Before Next Report</h4>
        <p> 
            For our next sprint we will prioritize completing the new event creation function and the "only Yale email address allowed" function.
            We will then shift our focus to appearnce of the app by adding header and footer and other UI related implementations. In our next meeting on 11/11, we may add additional story points.
