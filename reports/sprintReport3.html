        <h4>Narrative of Accomplishments and Challenges</h4>
        <p> 
            We continued progress on the website by prioritizing and assigning stories for Sprint 3.
            Bernardo created the new events functionality as well as ensured non-yale email addresses could not be accepted.
            Jeremy created the header and footer for our web app. 
            Vincent and Jeremy began working on the support us page, they have made progress but the task was more difficult than anticipated and it has been extended into Sprint 3.
            Philippe compiled our Sprint 3 report.
            
            Note that since we are working on distinct features, we began using some branches to keep organized and minimize conflicts. We had difficulty finding time to meet as a group, but found that 
            Slack and ZenHub made it pretty simple to communicate asynchronously and still keep track of each team member's progress.

        <h4>Narrative of Expected Work Before Next Report</h4>
        <p> 
            For our next sprint we will prioritize adding the API and accessiblity features. Once all "must have" features are complete we will work on our "nice to haves" such as UI, user profiles, and a proper database.
